/**
 * Event-Driven Worker Interface
 *
 * Used to run full-featured applications with their own event loop in Worker Pool.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * Unlike WorkerCallbackInterface which is called for each connection,
 * EventDrivenWorkerInterface is launched ONCE on worker startup and allows
 * the application to have full control over the event loop.
 *
 * ## Workflow
 *
 * 1. Master starts Worker process (fork)
 * 2. Worker calls `run(workerId, server)` ONCE
 * 3. Application initializes (Database, EventBus, etc.)
 * 4. Application starts its event loop (while true)
 * 5. Master passes connections via `Server::addExternalConnection()`
 * 6. Application polls `Server::hasRequest()` in its event loop
 * 7. Requests are processed asynchronously via Event Bus
 * 8. Responses are sent via `Server::respond()` in another tick
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```php
 * class MyApp implements EventDrivenWorkerInterface
 * {
 *     public function run(int $workerId, Server $server): void
 *     {
 *         // IMPORTANT: Do NOT call $server->start()!
 *         // Master already manages the socket and passes connections to Server.
 *         // Server is automatically marked as "running" in Worker Pool mode.
 *
 *         // Initialization (ONCE)
 *         $eventBus = new EventBus();
 *         $db = new Database();
 *
 *         // Application event loop (INFINITE)
 *         while (true) {
 *             // Tick 1: Receive requests from Worker Pool
 *             if ($server->hasRequest()) {
 *                 $request = $server->getRequest();
 *                 $eventBus->dispatch('http.request', $request);
 *             }
 *
 *             // Tick 2: Process events
 *             $eventBus->tick();
 *
 *             // Tick 3: Send ready responses
 *             if ($server->hasPendingResponse()) {
 *                 $response = $eventBus->getResponse();
 *                 $server->respond($response);
 *             }
 *
 *             usleep(1000); // 1ms
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
